// deposits - deposit types the base game does not have, as a tesmioloader
// plugin, and the three subsystems one declaration drives.
//
// A deposit really is little more than a (texture, colour component) pair: the
// game stores richness as one byte of one channel of one of two 1024x1024 maps,
// and every per-type behaviour it has is a lookup keyed by the type number.
// deposits.ini declares them and this one table feeds all three:
//
//   the code patch   splices the type into the building.ini parser, the
//                    type-to-channel dispatch and the search-radius table. The
//                    only place in this project that emits instructions, and it
//                    emits them in a loop over the registry.
//   the minimap      a button and an overlay layer per deposit, from two
//                    additive inline hooks. No code patch: the overlay shader
//                    selects its channel with a full dp4, so all four
//                    components were reachable from the start.
//   the editor       a paint/erase pair per deposit, from four more additive
//                    hooks. Also no code patch: the engine's brush primitive is
//                    generic over an eight-value channel index and three of the
//                    eight simply had no caller.
//
// The registry is also published as a service, so another plugin can read what
// deposits.ini declared - and carry its own per-deposit keys in the same file.
// `depletion` does both.
//
// Everything here is addresses for SOVIET64.exe v1.1.1.9. See
// docs/05-deposits.md.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- maps past the engine's two
//
// The eight channels were never a property of the deposit system. They are two
// textures times four components, and the only thing that made two textures a
// limit is that the world loader creates exactly two of them. Everything
// downstream is already generic over which texture it is handed:
//
//   the sampler at 0x8360   takes a texture pointer as its fourth argument
//   the texel writer 0x238B00 reads one out of the game object, at a fixed offset
//   the overlay shader      binds whatever texture was put in stage 0
//
// So a third map needs no new engine machinery at all - it needs the three
// things the world loader does for the first two, done again:
//
//   140007B1A  CreateManagedTexture(middlepoint, "<folder>/resourcemap.dds")
//   140007B4E  tex->vtbl[2] (tex, path, 0, 0, 0, 0)      Load2DFromFile
//   140007B5C  tex->vtbl[19](tex)                        TextureAccessInitTempResource
//
// and the one thing the world saver does, at 0x7C20:
//
//   140007C6x  tex->vtbl[36](tex, "<folder>/resourcemap.dds")   SaveToDDS
//
// Neither needs a spliced prologue. The load side is an **import swap** on
// CreateManagedTexture: the world loader hands it "<folder>/resourcemap.dds",
// which is the one path that always carries the folder - `resourcemap2` falls
// back to the bare "resourcemap2default.dds" when a map ships without one - so
// seeing that path is both the signal that a world is loading and the name of
// the folder it is loading from.
//
// The save side redirects the **one call** that reaches 0x7C20, at 0x42CD0E. It
// was an inline hook on 0x7C20's prologue until that turned out to crash every
// save, and the call patch is both the fix and the better technique:
//
//   0042CD0B  49 8B D7           mov rdx,r15        the world folder
//   0042CD0E  E8 0D AF BD FF     call 0x7C20        <- the five bytes rewritten
//   0042CD13  48 8B 0D ...                          the return address
//
// 0x7C20's prologue is exactly 13 bytes, and byte 13 begins a **rip-relative**
// load of the stack cookie - `mov rax,[rip+0x98a414]`. So it can neither be
// stolen at 13 (a 14-byte jump overwrites that instruction's first byte, and
// the trampoline returns straight into the wreckage) nor at 20 (the copy would
// read the cookie through a displacement measured from the original address).
// A call site has neither problem: the argument registers are already loaded,
// the original is called by address with no trampoline at all, and five bytes
// of rel32 are the whole patch. See docs/07-pitfalls.md.
//
// The rel32 only reaches +-2GB, so it lands in a cave allocated next to the
// executable which holds one absolute jump to the detour.
//
// A map with no resourcemapN.dds of its own loads a **blank**, written once into
// the loader's own VFS. It cannot be the engine's `resourcemap2default.dds`:
// that file is not blank - components 0, 1 and 2 carry a stock uranium and
// bauxite layout, measured, and only its alpha is clear - and CreateManagedTexture
// caches by path, so two extra maps loading one file would be one texture.

// which is exactly 02-findings.md's dispatch table by component number. The
// base game passes only the three unit vectors for components 0, 1 and 2, so
// component 3 of either map goes unused. Note the sixth flag: the overlay
// function tests +0x18 but the row draws no button for it, so that layer is
// unreachable in the stock UI.
//
// Which of the two textures gets sampled is not chosen in the shader. The
// overlay always binds resourcemap to stage 0 and then, if the selected
// layer is one of the +0x10/+0x14/+0x18 three, binds resourcemap2 over the
// top of it - same stage, same slot. A mod layer binds whichever map its
// section names, once.
//
// Both hooks below are purely additive. The original function runs first,
// through a trampoline, completely unmodified; one button per mod layer and
// the selected layer's overlay pass are appended afterward, using state kept
// in the loader's own registry and never in the six-flag struct the base game
// owns. Mutual exclusion is kept by watching that struct (drop ours the moment
// any base-game layer is picked) and by clearing it ourselves when one of ours
// is picked instead. Nothing already shipping is touched, so there is no byte
// to verify beyond each hook's own prologue.
//
// One visible consequence of appending rather than splicing: a mod quad is
// drawn after the vanilla function's tail has already drawn the minimap frame
// and the region outlines, so it sits on top of them where the base game's own
// layers sit underneath.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- terrain editor deposit brushes
//
// The terrain editor's Resources tab draws five paint/erase pairs. Every mod
// deposit that declares one gets another, and none of it needs a code patch,
// because the editor turned out to be built almost entirely out of things that
// are already generic.
//
// Two facts make it easy.
//
// First, **tools are identified by name string, not by an enum.** The active
// tool is a pointer at editor+0xD428, and it points at the tool's descriptor,
// whose first field is its name - which is why the game can both `strcmp` it
// and read flags at +0x2B5 off the same pointer. The button drawer at 0x3826C0
// stores whatever descriptor it was handed straight into that field on a
// click, so a descriptor of our own becomes a fully first-class tool the
// moment it is drawn. Nothing has to be registered anywhere.
//
// Second, **the texel writer at 0x238B00 is already generic over the
// channel.** It takes an eight-value index and derives everything from it:
//
//     tex = (unsigned)(ch - 4) < 4 ? resourcemap2 : resourcemap;
//     switch (ch & 3) { 0: alpha  1: byte2  2: byte1  3: byte0 }
//
// so ch = map*4 + component', which is what DepositDef::editorChannel holds.
// Its only caller, 0x2350D0, maps the editor's five pairs onto 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
// with `if (2 < idx) idx++` then `idx + 1`, and that arithmetic cannot produce
// 0, 4 or 7 for any input. Those three channels are not missing a capability,
// they are missing a caller.
//
// Rather than reimplement 0x2350D0 - brush radius, strength, limit, the rate
// timer, and the guards that stop the brush painting through the open panel
// are all in there - the dispatch hook calls it with *bauxite's* index and the
// texel hook rewrites the one argument that differs. The "this map has
// bauxite" byte that call sets on the way past is saved and restored, so a map
// without bauxite does not quietly acquire it.
//
// Icons are loaded explicitly from "editor/tool_<name>.png", so a brush needs
// nothing but two PNGs in the VFS named after its `editor` key.

// v1.1.1.9 rvas throughout; old values noted per line. The first four are
// re-verified by their prologue at load. The last three are not - taken as raw
// function pointers with no check, same as cities' P_RENUMBER/P_SLIDER - so

#define TOOL_ICON_PATH    0xB4       // empty on every built-in tool - see below

// The hover text, and why our buttons had none.
//
// The "accumulator" every vanilla button is handed is one qword, not a buffer:
// when a button is hovered, 0x3826C0 writes the tool's **descriptor** into it
// (and into editorSelf+0xC8C0) at rva 0x382A29. The panel then hands that qword
// to 0x383BD0, which reads two fields off the descriptor it names:
//
//   tool+0x48 == 0   ->  wcscpy(editorSelf+0xD5A0, GetString(lang, tool+0x40))
//   tool+0x48 != 0   ->  the rich building tooltip, drawn at the mouse
//
// Every terrain tool has +0x48 == 0, so a mod brush takes the simple path and
// needs nothing but a text id at +0x40.
//
// So there was never anything missing from the buttons - the panel calls
// 0x383BD0 before it returns, which is before an appended hook has drawn
// anything, and our accumulator went nowhere. Calling the consumer ourselves,
// once, after our own buttons, is the whole fix.
