// daynight - one sunrise and one sunset per calendar day, as a tesmioloader
// plugin.
//
// THE BASE GAME RUNS THE TWO CLOCKS AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS
//
// The world object carries the calendar in two fields:
//
//   game+0x590   int    day of the year, 0..364
//   game+0x594   int    the year
//   game+0x59C   float  how far into the current day we are, 0..60
//
// and the day tick at 0x3346E0 is the whole of it: it adds
// `C3D_TIMER::PowerTime` to +0x59C every frame and, the moment that passes the
// 60.0f at 0x90AA78 (this build), zeroes it, increments +0x590 and wraps at
// 365 into +0x594. One calendar day is therefore 60 units of scaled game time
// and nothing else.
//
// The day and night themselves come from a completely separate state machine at
// 0x333BD0, and it steps once per **calendar day**:
//
//   phase = (day of year) % 13
//
//     0..5, 11, 12   daylight, with whatever weather the random roll picked
//     6              weathers/sunset2.ini
//     7              weathers/night.ini, night factor ramping 0 -> 1
//     8              weathers/night.ini, full night
//     9              weathers/sunset2.ini, night factor ramping 1 -> 0
//     10             weathers/day1.ini, forced clear
//
// so a full day/night cycle takes **thirteen in-game days**, and the night part
// of it lasts two of them. That is the desynchronisation: the date in the
// corner advances thirteen times for every sunrise.
//
//
// EXACTLY THREE PLACES DIVIDE BY 13, AND ONLY TWO OF THEM ARE THE WORLD'S
//
// Scanning .text for the magic constant 0x4EC4EC4F - what the compiler emits
// for a signed `% 13` - finds three sites and no more:
//
//   in the weather state machine at 0x333BD0. Reads game+0x590
//   in the light factor at 0x5CFC40. Reads game+0x590
//   in the lighting cross-fade at 0x8F50. Reads 0x9D54A0, which is
//   **not** the world object - a separate clock. Left alone.
//
// The light factor is the second copy of the same 13-phase logic, written out
// again. It returns a float - how lit the world is - and is read by the
// renderer and by two of the electricity functions. Patching only the state
// machine would have moved the sky and left the street lights on the old
// thirteen-day schedule.
//
//
// WHAT THIS PLUGIN DOES: IT LIES TO BOTH OF THEM ABOUT THE DATE
//
// Nothing is patched. Both functions are hooked, and each is handed a **day and
// a time-in-day re-derived from the position inside the current calendar day**
// rather than from the calendar itself:
//
//   u  = (day mod cycle_days) * 60 + time, over cycle_days * 60      0 .. 1
//   k  = floor(u * 13)                        which of the 13 phases  0 .. 12
//   t' = (u * 13 - k) * 60                    where inside it         0 .. 60
//   d' = a day congruent to k modulo 13, near the real one
//
// With `cycle_days = 13` this is the identity: k is day % 13, t' is t, d' is
// day. **Installing the plugin and leaving it at 13 would change nothing at
// all**; the default is 1, which is the synchronisation the plugin exists for.
//
// The two hooks differ in how the lie is delivered, and deliberately:
//
//   weather tick   WRITES to the world object - the weather index, the night
//                  factor and two flags - so it has to be handed the real
//                  object. The two fields are overwritten, the original is
//                  called, and they are put back. It runs on the simulation
//                  tick, immediately after the day tick that owns those
//                  fields, so nothing else is looking at them in between.
//
//   light factor   READS and returns a float; it writes nothing. Every object
//                  field it touches was read out of its disassembly -
//                  +0x5C4, +0x590, +0x59C, +0xE70, +0xE28, and no others - so
//                  it is handed a **scratch object of this plugin's own** with
//                  those five fields filled in. The world object is never
//                  touched, which is what makes it safe from the render
//                  thread.
//
// D' IS PICKED SO THAT IT LANDS IN THE SAME SEASON AS THE REAL DATE, and that
// is not decoration. The weather tick does not only take `day % 13` off the
// field: it also calls the snow-season test with it, and compares it against
// the winter boundaries per climate. A residue class modulo 13 has a
// representative every thirteen days, so taking "the next day at or after the
// real one" sweeps a thirteen-day window over the course of a single calendar
// day - and near a winter boundary that window straddles it, so the weather
// would flicker in and out of winter thirteen times a day. This plugin instead
// walks the representatives outward from the real date and takes the first one
// the game's own season test puts in the same season. Every season is at least
// a hundred days long, so one always exists.
//
//
// AND THE CYCLE THEN RUNS THIRTEEN TIMES TOO FAST, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF
//
// Compressing the cycle into one calendar day does not slow the calendar, so
// the cycle comes out thirteen times faster than the base game's. A calendar
// day is 60 units of scaled game time, which is a few seconds of real time, so
// the whole thirteen-step cycle goes by in that. It reads as "night tried to
// start and changed its mind", because that is exactly what it looks like.
//
// `day_scale` is what makes a calendar day last longer. Two versions have been
// through this and got it wrong in opposite directions:
//
//   Version 1.x stretched the CALENDAR ALONE by giving back most of what the
//   day tick had just added to +0x59C. The date really did slow, and nothing
//   else did: production, consumption, movement, everything is integrated per
//   frame from C3D_TIMER::PowerTime, while pollution decay, loan repayment and
//   notification expiry are called once per calendar day, from the day tick's
//   own rollover branch and nowhere else. Slowing only the calendar made those
//   three fire `day_scale` times less often than the per-frame systems they
//   balance against - pollution never settled, loans never repaid, and the
//   population starved in a winter that both ran away and lasted too long.
//   See docs/07-pitfalls.md, "Slowing one clock in a game that keeps two".
//
//   Version 2.0 fixed that by scaling the WHOLE simulation clock - the shared
//   C3D_TIMER at 0x9D4EE0 that PowerTime/Power/PowerKmh all divide by - so
//   every per-day and every per-frame quantity slowed together and the economy
//   stayed exactly the base game's, only slower in real time. That is honest,
//   but it also slows walking, construction and vehicle speed by the same
//   factor, and at the default 13x that reads as the whole world stuck in
//   slow motion - reported after the fact, in game, as citizens walking like
//   they are underwater and vehicles crawling slower than pedestrians.
//
// VERSION 2.1 GOES BACK TO SLOWING THE CALENDAR ALONE, AND FIXES THE THING
// THAT MADE THAT WRONG THE FIRST TIME. `slow = calendar` is the default again:
// nothing but +0x59C is touched, so C3D_TIMER and everything that reads it -
// walking, vehicles, construction, animation, production - keeps the base
// game's own real-time pace. What changes is that the three functions that
// broke under version 1.x are no longer left to the day tick's own, now-rare,
// rollover:
//
//   pollution   0x4D5F50   decay the grid, accumulate residential exposure
//   loans       0x4B9660   one day of interest and repayment, drop the paid
//   notices     0x4CD380   age the notification/offer list, drop the expired
//
// This plugin calls all three itself, directly, at the cadence the UNSLOWED
// calendar would have used - tracked in a private accumulator fed by the true
// PowerTime delta the day tick adds each frame, independent of what gets left
// in +0x59C for display. So pollution decays, loans get paid and notices
// expire at the base game's own real-time rate, while the date, the day/night
// cycle and everything keyed to a specific day of the year - the weather roll,
// the price recompute, the per-city tick - keep the deliberately slowed pace
// that makes a sunrise and a sunset visible at all. `slow = world` (version
// 2.0's behaviour) is kept for anyone who wants the uniform, honest-but-slow
// alternative; `slow = none` turns day_scale off.
//
// The lighting cross-fade duration at game+0xED4 is the one number that does
// not scale itself. 0x333F80-equivalent writes 15.0f into it on every weather
// change - a quarter of a calendar day. Its own clock is the timer at
// 0xA558A0, not the simulation one, so it is not slowed by any mode here and
// the fade is rewritten to the same fraction of the new phase after every
// tick.
//
// WHAT IS NOT FIXED, AND IS THE BASE GAME'S: the weather-change code allocates
// two C3D_LIGHTING objects on every change and never frees the previous pair.
// Four changes per cycle used to mean four per thirteen days; it now means
// four per day. Roughly 5 KB of leak per real minute at 1x speed - the
// textures behind them come from the managed cache and are not duplicated.
//
// Every address is SOVIET64.exe v1.1.1.9 and is verified byte for byte before
// anything is hooked or called. See docs/15-daynight.md.
