// needs - resources the citizens require, as a tesmioloader plugin.
//
// The base game gives a citizen four things to buy in a shop - food, meat,
// clothes and electronics - and the list is four straight-line blocks of code
// inside one 15 KB function. There is no table to extend and no name to hook.
//
// What there is, is a *shape*. A citizen carries an array of "demands", each
// one carrying a pointer to an ordinary resource record, and the shop tick is
// completely generic over it: it walks the customer's demands, walks its own
// storage slots, and sells whatever matches. Nothing in that path knows what
// food is. So a fifth demand pointing at a fifth resource is sold by the same
// code that sells the other four, with no patch anywhere.
//
//   rva 0x836960  FUN_140836960(game, person)   the citizen's daily plan. Resets
//                 person+0x110 to zero and rebuilds the demand list from nine
//                 conditional blocks - food, meat, clothes, electronics, then
//                 five service demands (alcohol, culture, sport, church,
//                 doctor). Reached from 0x830640 when a person is at home and
//                 ready to decide what to do.
//
//   rva 0x171DA0  FUN_140171da0(game, building)  the shop tick, building type 3.
//                 Its second half is the sale: for every customer in
//                 building+0xBD8, for every demand of kind 1 or 2, find a
//                 storage slot whose resource matches and move goods across.
//                 **This is the function nothing here has to touch.**
//
//   rva 0xE40F0   FUN_1400e40f0(parser, storage, class, capacity, resource)
//                 builds a storage's slot list while building.ini is parsed. For
//                 $STORAGE_DEMAND_* it hard-codes the four names; for a plain
//                 $STORAGE it loops the whole resource vector. Hooking it is how
//                 a shop gets somewhere to put the new goods.
//
// PERSON, the fields this plugin reads or writes:
//
//   +0x0D8  eleven status floats, in the order the script VM lists them:
//           happiness, food, health, soviet, alcohol, culture, sport, religion,
//           clothing, electronic, crime
//   +0x110  demand count
//   +0x118  demand array, stride 0x80, **capacity 7**
//   +0x4F0  unsatisfied-demand count, then ten 16-byte entries at +0x4F8. The
//           planner's own prologue fills it from whatever the last list had
//           left over, which is what raises "N Citizen(s) were unable to get X".
//   +0x71C  0 citizen, 1 soviet tourist, 2 western tourist
//   size    0x750, from the operator new in the constructor at 0x823290
//
// DEMAND, 0x80 bytes:
//
//   +0x00  float  amount still wanted
//   +0x04  float  amount wanted in total
//   +0x08  int    kind. 0xF while the entry is being built; 1 and 2 are the two
//                 the shop tick serves, and the difference is urgency - a food
//                 demand of kind 1 suppresses every service demand, which is
//                 what keeps the list inside its seven slots.
//   +0x10  Resource*
//   +0x18  Target[0], 0x34 bytes - where this demand can be satisfied
//   +0x4C  Target[1]
//
// The seven-slot ceiling is why this plugin **clones** rather than builds. An
// entry synthesised from scratch would need both Targets right, and those are
// the part of the layout that is least understood; an entry memcpy'd from the
// citizen's own electronics demand is already routed to the shops that stock
// electronics, and only the resource pointer and the two amounts have to
// change. One `like =` key therefore drives both halves of the feature: the
// demand is cloned from that resource's demand, and the storage slot is added
// to exactly those storages that already stock it.

// donor resource ended up in this storage and we did not, put us there too.**
// A warehouse that already stocks everything therefore matches the second half
// of the test and is left alone.
//
// `category` narrows that, and only ever narrows it. The donor already implies
// a category - `eletronics` lands in ADVANCED and MEDIUMADVANCED and nowhere
// else - so leaving it at `auto` is right most of the time. Naming one is for
// the case the donor cannot express: furniture in the big department stores
// but not in the small ones, both of which stock electronics.
// WHAT A BUILT BUILDING FORGETS
//
// `storage+0x94` holds the $STORAGE_* token number while building.ini is being
// parsed - the parser writes it with `mov [rdi+0x94],eax` at 0xE4260. **A built
// building does not keep it.** Every live storage reads back 0, which is the
// value for a plain $STORAGE, so a department store's shelf is indistinguishable
// from a warehouse by that field alone. Probing a real save is what settled it:
//
//   needs probe live storage token 0 class 0 cap 70.00 slots 3 donor@2 mine@-1
//
// - cap 70.00 and three slots is exactly $STORAGE_DEMAND_ADVANCED
//   RESOURCE_TRANSPORT_COVERED 70 from shop_prior.ini, and the token is 0.
//
// The composition survives, though, and it is unique per category: 0xE40F0 puts
// a fixed set of names in a COVERED demand storage and the five sets are all
