// accumulator - stationary batteries for the electric grid, as a tesmioloader
// plugin.
//
// The base game has no way to store electricity. It does, however, already
// move it exactly like any other resource, and that is the whole opening.
//
//
// HOW THE GAME MOVES ELECTRICITY
//
// Every building carries a vector of storages at building+0x970..0x978, stride
// 0xE0. One field of a storage is its transport class, and class 9 is
// RESOURCE_TRANSPORT_ELETRIC - the class of the `eletric` resource. A power
// plant has one, and so does every consumer.
//
//   FUN_140139a80  rva 0x139A80  the building dispatcher: one simulation tick
//                  over every building. It collects power plants (type 17) and
//                  transformers (19) into vectors of their own and calls:
//   FUN_1401b8ee0  rva 0x1B8EE0  (game, building) - walk the wires out of this
//                  building, collect every class-9 storage it can reach, and
//                  hand energy over through:
//   FUN_1401bdd40  rva 0x1BDD40  the transfer itself. Each receiver's share is
//                  (its capacity - its content) / (total shortfall), and the
//                  source may hand out at most dt * its own storage capacity.
//
// Nothing in that code knows the source has to be a power plant. The type is
// checked in one place only, and only to keep plants from being *receivers*
// (`type != 17 && type != 31`). So a battery needs no new mechanism at all:
//
//   charging     is free. A building with a large class-9 storage is filled by
//                the grid exactly like a consumer, because its storage is short
//                of its capacity and the distributor divides by shortfall.
//   discharging  is one call to FUN_1401b8ee0 for our own building, after the
//                dispatcher has run. The engine's own code pushes the charge
//                back out over the wires.
//   saving       is free. The charge lives in the game's own storage, not in a
//                counter of ours, so it goes into the save with everything else
//                and survives this plugin being removed.
//
// That leaves one real problem, and it is what most of this file is about: an
// empty battery declaring 5000 units of capacity has a shortfall of 5000 while
// the town it sits in has a shortfall of 200, so the proportional split hands
// it 96% of everything generated and blacks the town out until it is full.
//
//
// THE THROTTLE, AND WHY THERE IS NO STATE
//
// The one field the grid reads to decide how much a battery wants is its
// storage capacity, so that is what gets rewritten:
//
//   before the dispatcher   capacity = min(declared, content + charge * dt)
//                           - the shortfall the grid sees is one tick of charge
//                             rate, whatever the battery's real size is.
//   after the dispatcher    capacity = discharge rate, then call the engine's
//                           own distributor. Its `dt * capacity` ceiling is
//                           then one tick of discharge rate.
//   and then                capacity goes back to what building.ini declared.
//
// Both windows open and close inside a single call to this hook, so the
// declared capacity is saved on the stack and nothing is remembered between
// ticks. That is deliberate: a cache keyed on a building pointer would go stale
// on a world load, and every version of that bug in this project has cost a
// session (see docs/07-pitfalls.md, "Armed is a claim, not a fact"). The
// accumulators are re-found from the building vector every tick instead, which
// costs one pass over a pointer array and is always right.
//
// Discharging needs no "is the grid short" test either. FUN_1401bdd40 divides
// by the shortfall it finds and returns without moving anything when there is
// none, so a battery in a healthy grid hands out nothing on its own.
//
//
// DISCHARGING IS WHAT A TRANSFORMER DOES, NOT WHAT A PLANT DOES
//
// The first version called FUN_1401b8ee0, the power plant's distributor. It
// moved energy correctly and the battery still looked broken: the neighbouring
// substation filled once and then nothing happened, reporting 0 KV the whole
// time.
//
// A grid node hands out two separate things, and 0x1BB700's third argument
// picks which. It ends in
//
//   FUN_1401bdd40(game, b, storages, conns, buildings, what == 0, 1.0f)
//
// and that sixth argument gates the transfer: non-zero runs the tail of the
// function, which propagates slot quality - "there is voltage here" - and moves
// no energy; zero runs the body, which moves energy. The dispatcher runs both
// for every live transformer, voltage first.
//
// Energy without voltage is a dead end: nothing downstream draws, so nothing is
// short of capacity, and 0x1BDD40 divides by the shortfall it finds. The
// battery hands out one storage's worth and then correctly concludes the grid
// wants nothing.
//
// So a battery discharges the way a transformer does, through 0x1BB700, in the
// dispatcher's own order. FUN_1401d1e10 - the factory production tick that
// 0x1B8EE0 opened with, and that had to be suppressed for it - is not on this
// path at all.
//
// Everything here is addresses for SOVIET64.exe v1.1.1.9. See
// docs/10-accumulator.md.

// v1.1.1.9. The dispatcher was confirmed by what its body touches - the

// pointer at +0x10E8 - not by the offset alone.
#define P_DISPATCH_RVA    0x139A70   // was 0x139A80 - one simulation tick

                                     // storage to the buildings in its catchment

// FUN_1401bb700's third argument decides which of the two things a grid node
// hands out, and it is the whole reason this plugin stopped calling the power
// plant's version. It ends in
//
//   FUN_1401bdd40(game, b, storages, conns, buildings, what == 0, 1.0f)
//
// and that sixth argument gates the transfer: non-zero takes the tail of the
// function, which propagates slot quality - "there is voltage here" - and moves
// no energy at all. Zero takes the main body, which moves energy.
//
// The dispatcher therefore runs both, in this order, for every transformer it
// considers live: voltage first, energy second. A battery that only did the
// second one filled its neighbour's storage once and then stopped, because
// without voltage nothing downstream draws, without draw there is no shortfall,
// and 0x1BDD40 divides by shortfall.
// The fourth argument is a per-connection priority filter, matched against the
// byte at building+0xE22+connectionIndex. -1 skips the filter - but only the
// filtered form reaches a neighbour the dispatcher has flagged as unpowered
// (`+0x1130`), which is exactly the state a substation hanging off a battery is
// in. So energy goes out priority by priority, the way the dispatcher does it
// for a priority transformer, and voltage goes out unfiltered first.

// The substation has two buildings in its catchment, they are short of 0.32,
// and it has a voltage at the top of the tick. Somewhere inside the tick that
// voltage is cleared - and 0x1B9640, the call that would have handed its
// storage to those two buildings, runs *after* that point. It hands out nothing
// because 0x1BDD40 refuses to move anything from a source whose slot quality is
// zero.
//
// Everything this plugin tried before restored the voltage after the dispatcher
// had finished, which is always too late: the clearing happens again next tick,
// still ahead of the hand-out. So the restore has to sit between the two, and
// the only seam there is 0x1B9640 itself.
//
// The hook therefore raises the quality of a substation **that a charged
// battery is wired to** back to full immediately before it distributes. Its
// catchment then draws, its storage empties, and the shortfall that creates is
// what the battery's own discharge fills after the tick - which is the loop
// closing the way it does for a power plant.
//
// Nothing else is touched: a substation with no battery on it is left exactly
// as the engine left it, dark if the engine says dark.
