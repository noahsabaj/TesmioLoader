// easystart - a citizen's needs arrive with the century, as a tesmioloader plugin.
//
// A map that starts pre-populated hands the player a town whose citizens want
// electricity, running water, central heating and a cinema on the first day.
// They lived without all of it the day before. This plugin holds each need back
// until a year in `plugins/easystart.ini`.
//
// It holds back the **consequences only**. A cinema built in 1925 is still
// walked to, a shop still sells clothes, a pub still serves; those things
// simply do not feed happiness yet, and their absence costs none.
//
// A need has four faces in this game and all four have to be gated, which is
// what the first version got wrong: it gated the first and left the other three
// visible.
//
//   1. the citizen's own demand list      -> happiness and health
//   2. the rate a building subtracts      -> happiness and health
//   3. the counters a building panel draws -> "56 Citizen(s) without power"
//   4. a real mechanic                    -> children in school, parents at work
//
//
// 1. WHAT A NEED IS, AND WHERE THE LIST OF THEM CAME FROM
//
// The game keeps an itemised ledger of why happiness and health moved, and the
// statistics window draws it. Both drawers walk a float array immediately
// followed by an int array of the same length, with a base language id
// incremented once per entry, so one `mov r12d,<id>` gives the whole table:
//
//   happiness  23 reasons, ids 54031..54053
//   health     12 reasons, ids 54003..54014
//
// Scanning `.text` for `inc dword ptr [rip+X]` landing in either count array
// maps every reason to the code that raises it. That scan is the map of this
// feature. Two negatives fell out of it and both matter: **there is no
// "no sewage" reason** - a full sewage store stops the building drawing water
// and the player sees *No water*, so sewage rides on the water gate - and
// reason 4, **"Job", has no writer at all**.
//
// The nine demand-carried needs are all decided in one function:
//
//   rva 0x83A6D0   FUN(game, person)
//
// one caller, inside the per-person tick right after the daily planner. It
// walks `person+0x118` and picks the reason from two fields and nothing else:
//
//   demand+0x08 == 3    alcohol       demand+0x10 == game[0xC300]  food
//   demand+0x08 == 4    church        demand+0x10 == game[0xC310]  meat
//   demand+0x08 == 5    culture       demand+0x10 == game[0xC318]  clothes
//   demand+0x08 == 6    sport         demand+0x10 == game[0xC320]  electronics
//   demand+0x08 == 10   hospital
//
// So a demand that is not in the array when this runs affects nothing, while
// one that is there everywhere else still routes the citizen to the pub. The
// gate is therefore a **pre/post bracket and no patch**: compact the locked
// entries out, call the original, put the array back byte for byte.
//
// Removing the entry removes the bonus with it. That is deliberate, and it is
// what "the early cinema changes nothing" means.
//
// The **status floats have to be held** or the unlock is a catastrophe: it is
// the *planner* that decays them, so twenty years of locked culture would rot
// that status to zero and the republic would turn miserable on the day the
// cinema starts counting. Health is never pinned - it is the citizen's real
// health - and neither is happiness, which is the thing being protected.
//
//
// 2. THE BUILDING SIDE IS TWELVE RATES IN .rdata
//
//   0x1BC210   the living tick        happiness: no electricity, no water
//   0x488B80   interior temperature   happiness and health
//   0x1B0950   drinking water         health
//
// Each computes its per-person amount **once before the loop over the
// inhabitants**, scales it by the "Unsatisfied citizens reaction" setting at
// game+0x5C8, and guards the ledger write with `ucomiss amount,0 / je`. So a
// zeroed amount is a complete no-op - no subtraction, no clamp, and nothing in
// the statistics either. Each amount is finalised by one rip-relative load of a
// .rdata constant, and repointing that displacement at a value this plugin owns
// is the whole patch. Overwriting the constants in place is wrong: 0x909ABC and
// 0x909AC4 are each read by two blocks.
//
//
// 3. THE PANEL COUNTS SEPARATELY, AND THAT IS WHAT WAS STILL SHOWING
//
// The living building's window draws "N Citizen(s) currently without power" and
// "N Citizen(s) are currently without drinking water" from four floats the
// living tick snapshots at the top of every pass:
//
//   building+0x1104 -> +0x1108 |  +0x110C -> +0x1110
//   building+0x1114 -> +0x1118 |  +0x111C -> +0x1120
//
// The panel takes `max(+0x1108, +0x1110, +0x1118)` for power and `+0x1120` for
// water. **The tick never reads the snapshots back** - it works from the
// accumulators - so zeroing them in a post-hook is invisible to the simulation
// and empties both lines. That is why this is a post-hook on the tick rather
// than a patch on the panel: one place, and the building's own state stays
// consistent with what is drawn.
//
// "Building is without power supply" is a third line and comes from a query,
// `0x1BBFE0(game, building)`, whose result the panel tests with `test al,al`.
// That query has twenty callers deep in the simulation, so it is not hooked:
// the panel's own `call rel32` at 0x76147B is rewritten to a thunk instead, and
// every other caller is untouched.
//
//
// 4. SCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN ARE ONE SETTING, AND IT SPLITS IN TWO
//
// Neither raises a happiness or a health reason, so neither is a need in the
// sense above. They are the game's own "Education simulation" option, which
// lives at **game+0x5DC** - `0` is Complex, `1` is Simple - and whose help text
// (language id 713) is exactly the two behaviours wanted: *children
// automatically reach basic education (no elementary schools needed); parents
// can work even while their children are under 6 (no kindergarten needed)*.
//
// Writing that field is not an option - it is saved with the world and read by
// windows - so the seven places the *simulation* tests it are rewritten to
// `cmp dword ptr [rip+ours], imm8`, which is the same seven bytes (eight with a
// SIB byte, plus a nop). Each site keeps its own immediate; only the memory
// operand moves. And because the sites divide cleanly, **school and
// kindergarten get separate years**:
//
//   school        0x823AE9, 0x824116, 0x824145, 0x834D65   education at birth
//                 0x7618E7                                 the panel's warning
//   kindergarten  0x824AEB   a parent of a child under 6 searching for a place
//                 0x761928                                 the panel's warning
//
// The five sites in the statistics window and the renderer are left alone.
//
// Addresses are for SOVIET64.exe **v1.1.1.9** and every one is compared against
// the bytes this build is known to have before anything is written. The first
// version of this plugin was derived against v1.1.1.7 and every code address in
// it was wrong by +0x70, +0xA0 or +0x1E0. See docs/16-easystart.md.

// pinned status (not the demand-hiding: that is inherently transient, and the
// citizen's own very next tick already brackets it correctly) and the cleared
// warning counters directly. Nothing here is a hook; it runs once, reads two
