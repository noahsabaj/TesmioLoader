// depletion - deposits that run out, as a tesmioloader plugin.
//

//
//   rva 0x1B3690  FUN_1401b3690(game, building)   one mine, one tick. Called
//                 from the building dispatcher at 0x139A80 for every building
//                 whose type is 7. (0x1B1220, its twin, is the type 92 water
//                 well; that one already resamples itself and is left alone.)
//
//   building+0xDDC   production rate this tick, recomputed every call as
//                    workers * quality * max. Zero when the mine is stopped,
//                    unpowered, unstaffed or its storage is full, so
//                    integrating it charges only for output that really
//                    happened.
//   building+0xDF8   quality of source, 0..1. Written once at construction and
//                    then never again for an ore mine - so it is free for this
//                    plugin to own.
//
// So: integrate the production rate, and take the tonnage out of the deposit
// map itself. Draining the texture rather than a private counter is what makes
// depletion persist through a save, show under the minimap overlay, and be
// shared by every mine over the same patch.
//
//
// WHY THE TEXTURE IS NEVER TOUCHED FROM THE TICK
//
// The first version of this plugin resampled each mine from the tick by calling
// the game's own scan at 0x1DD190, the way the water branch of 0x1B3690 does.
// **That crashed the graphics driver**, and the reason is worth writing down
// because nothing about it is visible from the game's side.
//
// `TextureAccessOpen` on `C3DAPI_D3D11_TEXTURE` is not a lock. Disassembled:
//
//   ID3D11Device::CreateTexture2D(&desc, 0, &staging)   // USAGE_STAGING, CPU rw
//   ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource(staging, gpuTex)  // vtbl+0x178
//   ID3D11DeviceContext::Map(staging, ...)              // vtbl+0x70
//
// and `TextureAccessClose` is `Unmap` plus the `CopyResource` back. That is the
// **immediate context**, which is not thread-safe and must not be touched from
// a simulation thread while the renderer is using it - and it drags the whole
// 4 MB map across the bus in both directions every time.
//
// The base game never does this from a building tick. Every caller of 0x1DD190
// that maps a texture is a main-thread path: building placement (0x2BAD70,
// 0x7ABBD0) and the terrain editor (0x30D100). The one tick-side caller is the
// water branch - and water, deposit type 8 or 9, is excluded from both of that
// function's texture guards (`type < 3` and `type - 6 < 2`), so it is precisely
// the one deposit type that touches no texture at all. Taking it as a template
// missed exactly the thing that made it safe.
//
// So the work is split:
//
//   the tick     arithmetic only. Integrates production, spends it against a
//                reserve held in this plugin, and writes quality of source.
//                Reads two floats out of the building and nothing else.
//   the flusher  seeds a mine's reserve from the map, and writes accumulated
//                depletion back into it. Runs from an import hook on
//                C3D_TERRAIN::Render - unambiguously the render thread, and
//                rate-limited, so one Map/Unmap pair covers many seconds of
//                mining across every mine at once.
//
// Everything here is addresses for SOVIET64.exe v1.1.1.9. See
// docs/08-depletion.md.
