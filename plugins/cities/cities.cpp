// cities - a per-city radius and shape, as a tesmioloader plugin.
//
// A city in this game is a "name point": a name, a world position, and a list
// of the buildings that belong to it. Which buildings those are is decided in
// exactly one function, and it is decided by one hard-coded number.
//
//   0x3305F0  NamePoint* FindCity(Game*, const C3DVECTOR3* pos, bool create)
//
//     limit = [0x90B214]            ; 1e6  - the radius SQUARED, so 1000 m
//     best  = [0x90B23C]            ; 1e10 - the "nothing yet" sentinel
//     for (np : game->namepoints)   ; game+0x10348 .. +0x10350, vector<NamePoint*>
//         if (np[0x118]) continue                       ; transient skip flag
//         d = C3DCalcDistanceSq(pos, np+0x04)           ; 3D, squared
//         if (limit <= d) continue
//         if (best  <= d) continue
//         best = d; result = np
//     if (result) return result
//     if (!create) return 0
//     ... pick a random unused name, AddNamePoint, ReassignBuildingsNear ...
//
// So the radius is one `movss xmm7,[rip+disp32]` reading 1e6, shared by every
// city on the map, and there is nowhere in the NamePoint that a per-city figure
// could live. That is the whole of what this plugin changes.
//
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE PATCH
//
// The search is replaced, the creation is not. An inline hook on 0x3305F0 runs
// this plugin's own search - per-city radius, circle or square - and returns
// what it finds. When it finds nothing and `create` is set it calls the
// original, which is the game's own "invent a name, allocate a NamePoint, push
// it into the vector, reassign the neighbourhood" path. **Nothing about
// creating a city is reimplemented here**, which is the point: a city this
// plugin causes to exist is indistinguishable from one the game made.
//
// For that to work the original's own search has to fail, or it would answer
// from the vanilla 1000 m before ever reaching the creation half. The one
// `movss` at 0x330658 is therefore repointed at a float this plugin owns,
// holding 0.0f: `comiss xmm7,xmm0 / jbe skip` then skips every candidate,
// whatever the distance. The literal at 0x90B214 is left alone - it sits in the
// shared pool with unrelated readers, exactly as 480.0f does for `walking`.
//
// The reassignment is replaced outright (0x32FEA0), for two reasons. It carries
// its own copy of the 1000 m figure as a box pre-filter, and - more
// importantly - it dereferences the *old* city without checking it for null.
// Vanilla never has a building without a city; this plugin can produce one for
// as long as it takes to adopt it, so the null-safe version is not optional.
//
//
// WHERE THE RADIUS LIVES
//
// Nowhere in the game's own structures. The NamePoint is 0x1C0 bytes with no
// spare field whose meaning is known, and its save record is a fixed 0x130
// bytes the loader reads field by field:
//
//   +0x00 float x,y,z      +0x0C wchar name[128]   +0x10C u32   +0x110 u32
//   +0x114 u8              +0x118 u32 buildingCount +0x11C u32 hasBlob
//
// followed by `buildingCount` u32 building indices and, when hasBlob, 0x80
// more bytes. So this plugin keeps its own table, keyed by NamePoint*, and
// serialises it **appended to namepoints.bin after everything the game
// writes**, keyed by position in the vector - which is the same key the game's
// own loader uses (record i -> vector[i]). The game reads exactly as many
// records as there are name points and then stops, so the extra block is
// invisible to it and a save stays loadable with the plugin removed.
//
// The two call sites are rewritten rather than hooked: `call 0x333440` at
// 0x42DB95 saves, `call 0x3337D0` at 0x431D56 loads, and both hand over the
// FILE* this plugin needs. Same technique as the deposits plugin's world-map
// save. fread/fwrite are taken from the game's own import table, because a
// FILE* from the game's CRT means nothing to the plugin's own.
//
//
// THE WINDOW
//
// 0x7CEDB0 builds the city window - the one with "Date established" and the
// "Allow citizens to move in" checkboxes - and leaves its bottom edge in
// window+0x250. A post-hook reads that, draws a slider and a checkbox there
// with the game's own widgets (0x272780 is the 0..100 slider, 0x273AF0 the
// checkbox), and writes the new bottom back, which is what makes the frame grow
// by two rows instead of clipping them. Same trick as `depletion`'s reserve row
// on the mine window.
//
// A window is a city window when window+0x248 == 3; window+0x240 is then the
// NamePoint. Both come from the dispatcher at 0x6EA0E3, which is also where the
// city window's relationship with the city hall lives: a working $TYPE_CITYHALL
// (building type 0x27) in the city makes the dispatcher draw that building's
// own panel inside the city window as well.
//
//
// WHAT HAPPENS TO A BUILDING THAT FALLS OUTSIDE
//
// Shrinking a city can leave buildings with no city at all, and the game has no
// concept of that. After every change the plugin rebuilds the whole assignment
// (RebuildAll) and then walks the buildings once more; anything still without a
// city is handed to FindCity(create=true) - the game's own creation path, with
// the game's own random name and the game's own "date established". Creating
// one city adopts every orphan inside its radius, so the pass converges in as
// many creations as there are genuinely separate clusters.
//
// Everything here is addresses for SOVIET64.exe v1.1.1.9, verified byte for
// byte before anything is written. See docs/14-cities.md.

//   np = window[0x240]
//   for (x = np.x - R;  x <= np.x + R + 5;  x += 50)
//       h = sqrtf(R*R - (x - np.x)^2)       ; the chord of the circle at this x

//   0x312754  comiss xmm0,xmm8
