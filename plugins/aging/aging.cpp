// aging - tying a citizen's age to the calendar.
//
// STATE: this is the measuring half, and it is all that is here yet. It finds
// the age field and the rate it moves at; the correction lands once those two
// numbers are known. Nothing in this plugin changes the game.
//
//
// WHY A PROBE AND NOT A PATCH
//
// The field is not where the notes said it was, and both of the candidates
// static analysis offered turned out to be something else:
//
//   person+0x70    docs/02-findings.md called this the age. It is not: the
//                  per-person tick at 0x832CB0 **resets it to zero** at
//                  0x8337C0 and 0x8338F9 and accumulates the frame time into
//                  it in between. It is a state timer. What reads it is
//                  0x8368B0, which turns it into an eight-step factor through
//                  the thresholds 30/60/90/120/150/180/210 at 0x90A9B8 and on
//   person+0x65C   grows as `dt * person[0xA4] * 30.0 * k`, k in {1, 2, 5},
//                  which reads like an age and is not. It **wraps back to
//                  zero** when it passes `record[0x9C] - 1`, it is seeded at
//                  birth with `C3DRandom_Float(0, record[0x9C] * 0.5)`, and
//                  `record` is a 0xB0-byte entry reached through the object at
//                  person+0x668. A quantity that loops over a per-object frame
//                  count, seeded at a random point so nobody moves in lockstep,
//                  with 30 as its rate and 5x while moving: that is the walk
//                  animation, not a life.
//
// The game's own script API declares `Person.fAge` as a float and
// `Person_SetAge` as instruction 31004, but neither the names nor the id are
// anywhere in the executable - the API is documentation, not data - so there is
// no string to cross-reference. The person constructor at 0x823290 never writes
// an age, and neither does the per-frame tick: every `dt *` in it lands in
// +0x10, +0x28, +0x48, +0x70, +0x90, +0x65C or +0x680. So the age is advanced
// somewhere else, and reading outward from a wrong guess is how the two above
// were nearly written down as facts.
//
// docs/03-reverse-engineering.md ranks runtime observation above static
// analysis for exactly this, and it is right: one in-game week of watching real
// citizens answers "which offset is the age" and "how fast does it move"
// together, and the second number is the whole of the calibration.
//
//
// WHAT IT DOES
//
// Snapshots whole Person objects and diffs them across calendar days.
//
//   the people      the engine's live vector of Person*, at 0x9E75B8..0x9E75C0
//   the date        game+0x590, day of the year, through the world object
//                   pointer at 0x9941F0
//   the clock       an import hook on C3D_TERRAIN::Render, because it needs a
//                   per-frame call and nothing else here does. It chains: the
//                   depletion plugin hooks the same import and both survive
//
// Every time the date changes it re-reads each tracked person and reports each
// 4-byte slot whose float value moved. A field that grows by the same small
// amount every day, out of a value that looks like a human age, is the age -
// and its daily delta is the number the correction needs, because the fix is
// arithmetic from there: one year per 365 of those steps.
//
// Everything is bounded and guarded. It reads; it writes nothing.
