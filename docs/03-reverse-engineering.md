# Reverse engineering — the toolkit

Four techniques, in the order to reach for them. Each is cheap where the one
below it is expensive. Most of what is in [02-findings.md](02-findings.md) came
from the first three; Ghidra was needed exactly once, and it was decisive.

Everything described here lives in `tesmioloader/tools/`, and the Ghidra project
in `tesmioloader/ghidra/proj`. Both used to sit in a session scratchpad under
`%TEMP%`, which is not a place to keep a 295 MB analysis database.

## `tools/` and `ghidra/` are not in this repository

Both are in `.gitignore` and have been since the first commit, so **every
`tools/…` path in this file and in the rest of `docs/` names a script you will
not find in your checkout.** They are on the author's machine only.

This is deliberate rather than an oversight, and nothing is lost by it:

- The **Ghidra project** is a derived artifact. It regenerates from your own
  copy of `SOVIET64.exe` in a few minutes of analysis — see
  [Ghidra](#4-ghidra--when-the-others-run-out) below.
- The **Python helpers** (`tools/pe/*.py`, `tools/assets/*.py`) are small
  single-purpose scripts, and this page spells out what each one does and the
  arguments it takes. Rewriting the one you need is an afternoon at most, and
  most of them are thirty lines around `pefile` or `struct`.
- `tools/signing/` holds the private half of the release key. That one is not
  obtainable and is not meant to be — a third-party build is *correctly*
  unsigned, and the launcher says nothing about it rather than accusing it of
  anything. See [09-plugins.md](09-plugins.md).

So read a `tools/…` path here as *"the technique, and what a script for it
would take as arguments"*, not as a command you can run.

## 1. PE structure — free, instant, no game running

Import tables, export tables, sections, the exception directory. Answers
"what does this binary talk to" and "where does this function begin and end".

The exception directory (`.pdata`) is worth knowing about: every function in an
x64 PE has a `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` record with its exact start and end. Given any
address inside a function, its bounds come straight out of that table — no
heuristics. That is how `ResourceGet` was measured at 735 bytes and the deposit
dispatch at 3734.

For `C3DDLL64.dll` the export table is a symbol file: 2218 MSVC-mangled names.
`undname` turns them into signatures.

## 2. String cross-references — the workhorse

The technique that found nearly everything:

1. Locate a distinctive string in `.rdata`.
2. Scan `.text` for RIP-relative `lea` instructions computing its address —
   `REX.W 8D /r` with `mod=00, rm=101`, target `rip + disp32`.
3. Map each hit to its containing function through `.pdata`.

`"ResourceGet - not found %s"` had exactly one reference, and that reference was
inside the resolver. `$TYPE_MINE_*` had two — the .ini parser and the
type-to-name function. `%s/resourcemap.dds` gave the world loader.

**Where it fails:** any function that touches no string. The deposit sampler
works on an already-loaded buffer and references nothing quotable, and no amount
of scanning would have found it.

Two traps, both hit here:

- In PowerShell, `"$TYPE_MINE_COAL"` interpolates to an empty string. Use single
  quotes.
- A naive byte-at-a-time search over a multi-gigabyte process takes ~40 seconds.
  `memchr` is vectorised and turns that into about a second.

## 3. Runtime observation — when static analysis runs out

Hook first, understand later. Deriving behaviour from live data is usually
faster and always more trustworthy than reading disassembly.

This is how the resource system was mapped: hooking `ResourceGet` and logging
every `(name, return value)` pair produced the complete enum in one game load,
including the record stride, the array base, and the failure sentinel — none of
which had to be guessed.

Variants used here:

- **Import hooks** for anything named.
- **Vtable hooks** for virtual calls, which no import hook can see.
- **Guard pages** — `VirtualProtect` with `PAGE_GUARD`, catch the fault in a
  vectored handler, record `RIP`. Finds *who reads this memory* when there is no
  symbol to hook.

The guard-page probe is still in the loader (`probe_map`). It answered its
question — the deposit map buffers are never read by game code — and that
negative result is what justified opening Ghidra. Three lessons from building
it, all learned by crashing:

- `VirtualProtect` rounds to page boundaries. Guarding a range that is not
  page-aligned protects bytes outside the buffer; a guard fault the handler
  cannot attribute goes unhandled and kills the process.
- The scanner must skip regions it has already guarded, or it trips its own trap
  and, worse, disarms it.
- Finding the buffer by scanning is too slow to catch anything that happens at
  load time. Hooking `fread` and taking the destination pointer straight from
  the read is instant. Track several streams: the deposit map is opened twice in
  the same millisecond and a single-slot cache captures the wrong one.

## 4. Ghidra — for control flow that has to be read

**Installed at `A:\Programs\ghidra_11.3.2_PUBLIC`.** Java 21 is on `PATH`.

Use it when the question is *what does this code decide*, not *where is it* or
*what does it do to data*. Concretely: chains of comparisons, switch tables,
struct field arithmetic. It is the only way to answer "which colour channel does
deposit type 6 read", and that answer was unobtainable by any other means here.

Do not use it to find functions — string xrefs are faster. Do not use it to
learn behaviour — hooking is faster and reflects reality.

### Headless usage

No GUI needed, and the project is already imported and analysed. `tools/ghidra/run.bat`
wraps the whole invocation:

```
tools\ghidra\run.bat <Script.py> <script args...>
```

It opens `tesmioloader\ghidra\proj` with `-process SOVIET64.exe -noanalysis`, so
a script runs in seconds. **Keep that project.** If it is ever lost, re-import
once — which takes a few minutes:

```
analyzeHeadless.bat <projdir> soviet -import "<game>\SOVIET64.exe"
```

It is 295 MB and `.gitignore`d.

Run it through `cmd /c` on an absolute path, or the `.bat` is not found. Long
runs get moved to the background; the first decompile of a very large function
can take several minutes.

### The scripts

`tools/ghidra/`, Jython (Python 2). These used to live in a session scratchpad
and were nearly lost twice.

| Script | Arguments | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Xrefs.py` | out.txt, addresses… | every function referencing each address. **Start here** — it maps the call graph without decompiling anything |
| `DecompAt.py` | out.c, addresses… | decompiles whatever contains each address |
| `DecompTargets.py` | out.c | decompiles a fixed list of interesting functions |
| `Callers.py` | out.c, address, limit | lists and decompiles callers of a function |
| `Disasm.py` | out.asm, start, end | raw disassembly with bytes — required for writing a patch |
| `DisasmMany.py` | out.asm, start:end… | the same for several ranges in one run |
| `FindStringXrefs.py` | out.txt, string | code references to a literal |

**`Disasm.py` is a trap on Windows.** Ghidra resolves a script name
case-insensitively and searches its own paths as well as `-scriptPath`, so
asking for `Disasm.py` can run `tools/pe/disasm.py` — the capstone one, which
takes different arguments, fails on `No module named capstone`, and still exits
0. Use `DisasmMany.py`; it has no twin.

`Xrefs.py`, `DecompAt.py` and `DisasmMany.py` are the three you will reuse.
Decompiled C is enough to understand a decision; **writing a patch, or a hook,
needs the disassembly**, because you have to know the exact instruction lengths
and encodings you are replacing.

The mine tick was found this way in four runs: `DecompAt` on the deposit
function, `Xrefs` on it to get five callers, `DecompAt` on the two that looked
like building updates, then `Xrefs` again to find which building type each one
belongs to.

### Standalone tools

`tools/pe/` and `tools/assets/`, ordinary Python 3, no game running:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bytesat.py` | bytes at an RVA, formatted as a `k*Prologue` array. How every hook site is recorded and, after an update, how a mismatch is diagnosed |
| `rdata.py` | a `.rdata` constant at an RVA as float, int and double |
| `xref.py` / `xref_wide.py` | RIP-relative references to a string, narrow and wide |
| `findstr.py` | locate a literal in `.rdata` |
| `imports.py` | IAT slot RVA → `dll!name`, or the reverse |
| `disasm.py` / `sovdis.py` | capstone over a known range |
| `checkcave.py` | re-implements the patch emitter in Python and disassembles it — the way spliced code is verified |
| `channels.py` | non-zero byte counts per colour channel of every map's `resourcemap*.dds`. Re-run after a game update before assuming a channel is still free |
| `dds2png.py`, `tint_dxt1.py` | asset conversion and DXT1 endpoint recolouring |
| `btf.py` | language files. `find <text>` resolves a label the game draws to its id, which is an immediate in the code and therefore a one-grep route to the UI function that draws it. `unpack`/`pack` convert a `.btf` to editable text and back, `patch` applies an overlay of a few ids to a stock file, `selftest` round-trips all twenty-one byte for byte |
| `btf_gui.py` | the same two conversions as a window, for translators rather than for debugging. `btf_gui.bat` opens it. It imports `btf.py` rather than repeating it, captures the warnings `btf.py` writes to `stderr` — `None` under `pythonw` — into a log pane, and reads a packed file back before reporting success |
| `nmf.py` | a mesh's submaterial names, so a cloned building's `.mtl` declares the right ones instead of guessing. `--mtl` prints a skeleton, `--nodes` lists `$COST_WORK_BUILDING_NODE` candidates |
| `restable.py` | the engine's resource table replayed instruction by instruction: the exact contents of all 57 resource records, without the game running. `classes` and `record <name>` report; **`verify` rebuilds every record from the field set `plugins/resources` knows and diffs all 832 bytes** — 57 of 57 identical is what says the layout is complete. Re-run after a game update |

### Sanity check the decompiler

Always include one function whose behaviour you already know from runtime. This
project decompiled `ResourceGet` alongside the unknowns: it showed the name
arriving in the second parameter and a pointer coming back, matching the logs
exactly. Agreement there is what makes the rest trustworthy.

## 5. Shader disassembly — for anything drawn on the GPU

`media_soviet/shaders_d3d11/*.inix` are effect files: a technique name followed
by its vertex and pixel `DXBC` blobs, each blob's length at its own `+0x18`.
Feed a blob to `D3DDisassemble` in `d3dcompiler_47.dll` — present on every
Windows machine, no SDK and no `fxc` needed — and it returns annotated assembly
plus a full reflection of every constant buffer, sampler and texture slot,
including which fields the shader actually reads.

```python
dll = ctypes.WinDLL("d3dcompiler_47.dll")
dll.D3DDisassemble(blob, len(blob), 0, None, ctypes.byref(out))   # out is an ID3DBlob
```

`ID3DBlob` has no COM subtleties worth worrying about: `vtbl[3]` is
`GetBufferPointer`, `vtbl[4]` is `GetBufferSize`.

Do this before assuming a shader has to be patched. The minimap deposit overlay
turned out to select its colour channel with a `dp4` against a float4 constant,
which made the unused alpha channel reachable with no patch at all.

## Replaying a builder, for a structure that has no symbols

The technique that finally settled the resource record, after three years of
"clone an existing one and hope". Worth reaching for whenever a structure is
**filled by straight-line code with one block per instance** — resource tables,
building-type tables, anything a developer wrote out by hand.

The engine's resource table is 30 KB of `mov [rbp+disp], imm32`. Nothing in it is
a symbol and nothing is a string, so techniques 1 and 2 cannot touch it and
technique 3 only ever shows the finished bytes. But the code *is* the structure
definition: disassemble the range, keep every store whose base register is the
frame pointer, and replay them into a buffer.

What made it exact, and what would break a naive version:

- **Anchor the frame pointer to the structure.** `lea rbp,[rsp-0x290]` before
  `sub rsp,0x390` makes `rbp == record + 0xC0`. Get that wrong by four bytes and
  every field is misattributed, consistently, with no sign of trouble.
- **Model the calls that clear part of the buffer.** One function in the middle of
  each block zeroes the eighteen transport-class entries. Skip it and one
  resource's values leak into the next.
- **Track registers, not just immediates.** A name arrives as
  `movabs rax, 0x7372656b726f77`; a float arrives as
  `movss xmm0,[rip+...]`. A store of a register is worthless without the value
  that got there.
- **The buffer persists between instances.** That is a finding, not noise: it is
  why every base-game record carries the tail of a previous, longer name after its
  own terminator.
- **Every commit idiom.** Records 0..34 commit with `add [rbx+8],0x340` and 35..56
  with `call push_back`. Following only the first is what made an earlier note in
  [02-findings.md](02-findings.md) say the table covered 35 of 57 records.

Then **close the loop**: rebuild each instance from the field list you think you
have and diff every byte against the replay. Anything the code writes that your
list has no name for shows up immediately, and the count is a one-line regression
test after a game update. `restable.py verify` is exactly that, and it is what
turned "the record is mostly unknown" into a from-scratch resource.

## A note on linear disassembly

Capstone stops at the first byte that does not decode, and `.text` is full of
jump tables and padding, so a single `md.disasm` over the section yields a few
hundred instructions out of millions. For a *known* address range it is ideal —
that is how the overlay's texture-bind stages were read. For finding references
across the whole section, use the displacement scan from technique 2 instead:
index every 4-byte window as a candidate RIP-relative operand, then keep the
hits whose preceding bytes decode as `REX.W 8D /r` with `mod=00, rm=101`. No
valid instruction stream required.

## Writing a code patch

Sequence, once `Disasm.py` output is in hand:

1. Pick a site with at least 5 bytes of a single instruction to overwrite. The
   deposit patch uses two 7-byte instructions.
2. Record the original bytes as a constant and compare before writing. A game
   update must make the patch refuse, not corrupt the process.
3. Allocate a cave **within ±2 GB** of the module — `call rel32` and `jmp rel32`
   cannot reach further. Walk allocation granularity outward from the module
   base until `VirtualAlloc` succeeds at a hinted address.
4. Emit the cave with every displacement computed from the runtime base.
   Reproduce the original instruction you displaced, then add yours.
5. Overwrite the site with `jmp rel32` and pad with `0x90`.
6. `FlushInstructionCache`.

Worked example: `PatchDepositType` in `plugins/deposits/deposits.cpp`.
