# Architecture

`tesmioloader` is a DLL injected into `SOVIET64.exe` at startup by a launcher.
It never modifies a file on disk.

It is a **host, not a mod**. The loader itself contains only infrastructure: the
VFS, the log, the hooking techniques, the crash handler and the plugin host.
Every feature — resources, deposit types, depletion — is a DLL in `plugins/`
that the loader hands a versioned table of what it knows how to do. See
[09-plugins.md](09-plugins.md).

Everything either of them does to the game is one of four things, listed here in
the order you should reach for them — the earlier ones survive game updates far
better.

## The four techniques

### 1. Import table entry swap — first choice

The game imports 733 named functions from `C3DDLL64.dll` and a few dozen from
the CRT and KERNEL32. Every one of those is a pointer in a table that can be
rewritten at runtime. No trampolines, no disassembly, no fixed addresses.

`FindIatSlot(module, dll, name)` walks `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT`, matches
the DLL name case-insensitively, then walks `OriginalFirstThunk` for names in
lockstep with `FirstThunk` for addresses and hands back the slot.

**Both modules have their own import tables.** Patching only the executable
leaves everything the engine does for itself invisible — this cost several
sessions when texture loads went unseen. Hook `SOVIET64.exe` *and*
`C3DDLL64.dll`.

### 2. Virtual table slot swap

Anything the game calls through a C++ interface never appears in an import
table. `C3DAPI_D3D11_TEXTURE` is the case that matters: its vtable is an
exported symbol, so the slot can be located without guessing.

### 3. Data pointer swap

The resource vector is three pointers in `.data`. Rewriting `end` publishes a
new record; rewriting all three relocates the array. No code is touched.

### 3½. Rewriting one instruction's operand

Between a data pointer swap and real spliced code. When the pointer to redirect
is not in a table but in a `lea`'s displacement, four bytes of operand is still
a data redirect in every way that matters: no cave, no trampoline, no change to
what the instruction *does*.

The main menu's version line is the case. It is one
`lea rax,[rip+disp32]` at rva `0x28B55C` computing
`L"v%d.%d.%d.%d (64 bit DX11.1 - GPU: %ls)"`, and repointing it at a longer copy
of the same format string is the whole feature — see
[02-findings.md](02-findings.md) for the site.

The alternative was hooking `C3D_FONTMANAGER::PrintLeftUnicode` through the
import table, which is normally the first choice and here is the wrong one: it
is a **variadic** that every label in the game goes through, and a `va_list`
cannot be forwarded to a variadic callee, so the hook would have to re-format
every string in the UI through its own CRT to pass anything on. Prefer the
operand when only one call site is meant to change.

The replacement string is placed by `AllocNear`, because a `rip`-relative
displacement is 32 bits and the loader's own image is not guaranteed to be
within ±2 GB of the executable.

The `walking` plugin is the second case, and it shows why the operand rather
than the constant: its rebuild radius is `530.0f` at `0x90AF70`, in the shared
literal pool with sixty-odd unrelated readers. Writing over it would move panel
widths as well; repointing the one `movss` that fills in the path query moves
exactly walking. The walking distance itself, in the same plugin, is a bare
`imm32` with nothing to share and is simply replaced — see
[12-walking.md](12-walking.md).

### 4. Spliced code — last resort

Only when a decision is compiled into a chain of comparisons and there is no
data to redirect. Used for exactly one thing in the whole project, the deposit
type — and even there the emitted code is generated from a config table rather
than written out per deposit. It lives in the `deposits` plugin; see
[05-deposits.md](05-deposits.md).

## Injection

`tesmiolauncher.exe` creates the game suspended, allocates the DLL path in the
target, and calls `LoadLibraryW` through `CreateRemoteThread`, then resumes.

The ordering matters and is not accidental. In a suspended process the loader
has not run, but a remote thread triggers `LdrInitializeThunk` first, so by the
time `LoadLibraryW` executes the executable's imports are fully resolved — while
no game code has run yet. Hooks are therefore installed from `DllMain` against a
complete import table, ahead of the first file the game opens.

`kernel32.dll` sits at the same base in every process of a boot session, so the
launcher's own `LoadLibraryW` address is valid in the target.

The working directory is set to the game folder: the game uses relative paths
like `media_soviet/...` throughout.

### Finding the game

The launcher used to assume one path, `<self>\..\..\SOVIET64.exe`, which is only
right when `tesmioloader\build\` is inside the game folder. Putting the folder
anywhere else — a common enough mistake — produced `game not found` and nothing
else to go on. Four strategies now run in order, and the first one that yields a
believable install wins:

| Order | Strategy | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `--game <exe or folder>` | someone who knows where it is |
| 2 | `game_exe` in `tesmioloader.ini` | the path the window saved last time |
| 3 | walk up from the launcher, looking one folder deep at each level | the folder put beside the game rather than inside it |
| 4 | Steam: registry `SteamPath` → `libraryfolders.vdf` → `appmanifest_784150.acf` → `installdir` | the folder put anywhere at all |

**A folder is only believed when `SOVIET64.exe` is in it beside `C3DDLL64.dll` or
`media_soviet`.** The exe name alone would also match a stray copy in someone's
Downloads, and injecting into that fails in a way nobody can read. Two acceptable
witnesses rather than one, because a Steam verify can be mid-flight.

Strategy 3 walks up at most 8 levels and looks exactly **one** level down at
each. One level is what the "beside instead of inside" case needs; a recursive
scan would be a way to walk someone's whole drive while they wait.

Strategy 4 never guesses the folder name — it finds the library that holds the
game's app manifest and reads `installdir` out of it, falling back to a scan of
that library's `steamapps\common` if the manifest is there but the folder moved.

`--find` runs all of it, prints what resolved, and exits without writing or
starting anything. It is the only way to see the losing strategies, since the
winner is the only one that leaves a trace once the game is up.

### The version gate

Every address in this project belongs to **v1.1.1.9**, PE `TimeDateStamp`
`0x6A3EB6AD` (2026-06-26) — the build the regular branch updated to on
2026-08-11, from v1.1.1.7 (`0x69C4098C`). The update's own notes called it
content-only; it was not, at the byte level — see *Porting off v1.1.1.7*
below — and every address in this project was re-derived against the new
build rather than kept as a second table entry. A patch site verifies its own
bytes and refuses on a mismatch, so a future update makes each hook decline
rather than corrupt the process — but that is a dozen separate refusals in a
log file nobody reads, after the game is already running. The launcher asks
once, before the process exists, and refuses to inject at all.

**`SOVIET64.exe` has no `VERSIONINFO` resource** — `FileVersion` is `0.0.0.0` —
so there is nothing to ask the shell. The version is read out of the only place
the game keeps it: the arguments it formats its own main-menu line from. The
exe is parsed as **data**, never loaded as a module; the launcher is about to
inject into that file and must not map it first.

| Step | What |
|---|---|
| 1 | find `"v%d.%d.%d.%d (64 bit DX11.1)"` in `.rdata` |
| 2 | scan `.text` for the one rip-relative `lea` that resolves to it — nothing here is hard-coded, which is exactly why this step alone survived the port unchanged |
| 3 | read the four immediates out of the 64 bytes in front of it |

Those bytes are `mov [rsp+0x20], build` / `mov edx, major` / `mov r9d, edx` /
`mov r8d, edx` — so `major.minor.patch` comes from a single immediate and the
build number from the fifth argument's stack slot. The scan is not a
disassembler: it looks for the exact encodings that can put a small constant
in each of those four argument slots and takes the last write to each.
**Anything it does not recognise leaves the numbers unread rather than
wrong**, and the `TimeDateStamp` then decides alone.

`kSupportedVersions` in `tesmiolauncher.cpp` is a table of one entry rather
than a bare pair of constants, checked in full:

| Numbers | Stamp | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| match the entry | matches its stamp | supported |
| match the entry | differs from its stamp | supported, *"a different build of it"* — a hotfix that left the printed version alone. Allowed, and said out loud |
| match nothing | — | **refused** |
| unreadable | matches the stamp | supported — the stamp is the stronger fact and this exe is byte-identical to the one it names |
| unreadable | does not match | **refused** |

Both facts are shown in the window and printed by `--find`, which exits `2` when
the game it found would not be launched. `version_check = 0` in
`tesmioloader.ini`, or `--ignore-version`, turns the refusal into a warning —
that switch is for whoever is porting the addresses to a build the table does
not name, not for playing on one.

The supported version is **compiled in**, not configurable. It is not a
preference: it is a statement about which addresses this binary was built with,
and a config key for it would only produce a launcher that injects confidently
into a game it cannot patch. During the v1.1.1.7 → v1.1.1.9 port the table
briefly held both builds, which is the whole reason it is a table and not a
pair of `#define`s — a future update can add a row the same way, and drop the
old one once its addresses are gone from the tree, exactly as v1.1.1.7's were.

### Porting off v1.1.1.7

What the port actually found, kept here because it is the one thing worth
knowing before trusting an update's own description of itself:

- **`.text` did not shift by one constant.** It grew in steps as the update's
  content pulled in more code ahead of a given point: `+0`, `-0x10`, `+0x70`,
  `+0xA0`, `+0xD0`, `+0x120`, `+0x1E0`, increasing the further into `.text` a
  site sat. A single global delta would have found nothing past the first
  step.
- **`.rdata`'s float-literal pool moved too** — by a uniform `-0x18` across
  the cluster every layout constant and rate this project reads sits in, and
  by `-0x20` in a second cluster further along (three UI tint colours, one
  overlay-shader vector). Two different shifts fifteen hundred bytes apart in
  the same section, confirmed independently by the *value* now at each
  candidate address, not assumed from the first one that worked.
- **`.data` did not move at all.** The game object, the resource vector, the
  simulation timer, every static this project reads by absolute address —
  unchanged, confirmed by the `lea` sites that resolve them still landing on
  the same targets.
- **A game constant changed value, not just address**: `daynight`'s day
  length went from `60.0` to `63.0`. Genuinely content, and indistinguishable
  from an address problem until checked — a stale `RVA_DAY_LENGTH` would have
  refused to install with no other symptom.
- **The method**: a prologue/pattern scanner over the byte arrays every hook
  already records as its expected prologue, filtered against the PE's own
  `.pdata` `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` table so a match had to be a genuine function
  start rather than a coincidental byte run inside one. Where a pattern alone
  was ambiguous - several candidates, or none - the tie-break was the code
  itself: what a function's body still reads (`+0xC300` for easystart's
  cached shop-goods records, `+0x11B08` for accumulator's building vector),
  what a `movss` still resolves to, which `.pdata` candidate's *size* looked
  like the right kind of function.
- **One crash, and it was a plugin-contract bug the port exposed rather than
  a wrong address**: `resources` installed a `C3D_LANGUAGE::GetString` import
  hook before its `ResourceGet` inline hook, and when the latter's address
  turned out to have moved, the host freed `resources.dll` with that import
  hook still live in it. See `docs/09-plugins.md` and the fix in
  `resources.cpp`.

### The window

`tesmiolauncher.exe` is `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS` and shows a small dialog: the
resolved game path with a Browse button, two lines about the game version, a
checkbox per plugin, and Launch. `--nogui` skips it and behaves exactly as the
program did before — the version gate included.

Plain Win32, controls created by hand. Themed controls come from a
`MANIFESTDEPENDENCY` on Common-Controls v6 declared in the source and embedded
with `/MANIFEST:EMBED`; the metrics are written at 96 dpi and scaled through one
`S()`, with `SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext` called on the **first line of
`wWinMain`** — the first dpi-sensitive call in a process fixes its awareness for
good, and doing it later silently leaves the window bitmap-stretched.

The title-bar icon is `logo.ico` — the same resource `src/tesmiolauncher.rc`
gives the exe, loaded again by hand at both `SM_CXICON` and `SM_CXSMICON`. **A
window's icon comes from its class, not from the executable**: without this the
exe has the logo in Explorer and on the taskbar and shows the default in its own
title bar. A build made without `rc.exe` has no icon resource and falls back to
the game's own icon, which is what this used to show.

#### The plugin list

Two columns in a child window of their own, scrolled with `WS_VSCROLL`. The
loader takes up to 32 plugins, and a column of 32 rows is taller than the work
area of a laptop screen — the old layout grew the window to fit the count, which
put Launch off the bottom edge for anyone who had that many. Row-major, so the
two halves of a scrolled list never slide past each other; `LIST_MAXROW` rows on
screen, and fewer when the work area will not take that many.

Scrolling is `ScrollWindowEx` with `SW_SCROLLCHILDREN`, so the OS moves the
checkboxes and nothing is repositioned by hand. A child window costs three
things and all three are paid: its children's `WM_COMMAND` and
`WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC` arrive at it rather than at the dialog and are forwarded,
tab traversal only descends into it because it is `WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT`, and the
wheel goes to whatever has the focus so the dialog forwards `WM_MOUSEWHEEL`
down. The checkboxes carry `BS_NOTIFY` for one reason: without it a button never
sends `BN_SETFOCUS`, and tabbing would park the focus on a row scrolled out of
sight.

**The group box is the only control here with `WS_CLIPSIBLINGS`, and it needs
it.** A group box paints its whole rectangle, everything in the group sits
inside that rectangle, and without the style it wipes the list on every repaint —
the checkboxes are then still there, still enumerable and still clickable, and
invisible, because they are grandchildren and painting over their parent never
asks them to draw. The style must go on the container and nowhere else: it
excludes every overlapping sibling from that window's own painting, so putting
it on the controls as well makes each of them clip the group box out of itself,
and the group box's rectangle covers all of them. Both mistakes were made in
that order; the second looks like the first.

A console is not opened. When output has somewhere to go it uses it: an inherited
`stdout` handle first, for a caller that redirected to a pipe or a file, and the
parent's console only when nothing was inherited. Reopening `CONOUT$` in the
first case would write past the redirection to a console nobody is reading.

## What is hooked

### Engine, through the executable's import table

| Symbol | Why |
|---|---|
| `C3DHelp_ReadFileIntoBuffer` | universal asset read — VFS |
| `C3DHelp_CheckIfFileExist` | existence must agree with the VFS |
| `C3DLog_PrintInfo` / `Warning` / `Error` | mirrors the game's own log into ours |

`C3D_LANGUAGE::GetString(int)` is hooked too, for mod resource captions, but by
the `resources` plugin rather than by the loader.

The log functions are variadic. A `va_list` cannot be forwarded to a variadic
callee, so the hook formats the text itself and passes the result on as `"%s"`.

### File opening, through **both** import tables

`fopen`, `fopen_s`, `_wfopen`, `_wfopen_s`, `fread`, `CreateFileA`,
`CreateFileW`, `CreateFile2`.

That list grew one entry at a time, each after an asset was found slipping past.
Assume it is still incomplete: when something is not being redirected, the first
question is which opener it used.

### Inline hooks

The loader installs none. It provides the mechanism — `installInlineHook`
relocates the prologue into a trampoline, writes `jmp qword ptr [rip+0]` over
it, and compares the site against the caller's expected bytes first so a game
update makes a hook refuse rather than corrupt the process — and the plugins use
it: `ResourceGet` (1), the minimap (2), the terrain editor (4), the mine tick
(1), the building dispatcher and the production tick (2).

That jump is **14 bytes**, and a prologue shorter than that cannot host it: the
jump would overrun into the next instruction while the trampoline returned into
the middle of the jump's own address operand. `installInlineHook` refuses below
14 rather than trusting the caller's byte count — the one site that got this
wrong crashed every save and logged `hook ok`, in
[07-pitfalls.md](07-pitfalls.md). Prologues that begin
`mov [rsp+8],rbx / push / sub rsp,imm32` are 13 bytes and are followed by a
rip-relative stack-cookie load, so they cannot be stolen at 13 *or* extended;
those sites are patched at the call instead.

Nine of the ten are additive — the original runs through the trampoline and the
plugin's work is appended. The exception is `accumulator`'s hook on the
production tick, which exists to **suppress** the original for one building for
the length of one call; see [10-accumulator.md](10-accumulator.md).

### Virtual table

`C3DAPI_D3D11_TEXTURE` vtable at `C3DDLL64.dll` rva `0x187BF0`, slots 2
(`Load2DFromFile`) and 20 (`TextureAccesGetTexel`). Load identifies which
texture object is which file; GetTexel observes deposit sampling.

## Subsystems

### Virtual file system

Any read whose path resolves under `tesmioloader/vfs/<same relative path>` is
served from there instead. Absolute paths are refused deliberately — the game
uses them for Workshop content, and redirecting those has never been wanted.

This is how mod resources get icons and cargo models, and how a terrain's
deposit map is replaced without touching the shipped file.

### Plugins

`build/plugins/*.dll` are scanned at startup and handed `TsmHost`, a versioned
table of what the loader knows how to do: where the executable is, how to swap
an import, how to splice a hook, how to log, how to read a config key, and a
noticeboard for publishing interfaces to each other. The contract is
`src/tesmio_api.h`; the mechanism and the two-phase init are in
[09-plugins.md](09-plugins.md).

Not a sandbox. A plugin is in the same address space and can corrupt the process
exactly as easily as the loader can. What it buys is that a feature can be
written, rebuilt and removed without touching this file, and that shipping one
is copying a DLL.

Six ship with the project:

| Plugin | What | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `resources` | resources the base game does not have | [04](04-adding-resources.md) |
| `deposits` | deposit types, the minimap layer, the editor brush | [05](05-deposits.md) |
| `depletion` | deposits that run out | [08](08-depletion.md) |
| `accumulator` | batteries for the electric grid | [10](10-accumulator.md) |
| `needs` | resources the citizens buy in a shop | [11](11-needs.md) |
| `walking` | how far a citizen walks | [12](12-walking.md) |
| `buildings` | new buildings, written out of a config file | [13](13-buildings.md) |

Plugins load **last**, after every import swap, so each sees a fully built
loader. `plugins = 0` skips the folder.

`buildings` is the one that patches nothing at all: it writes a Workshop item
into `media_soviet\workshop_wip\` from `plugins\buildings.ini` and then does
nothing for the rest of the process. It is a plugin because it is a feature, not
because it needs anything from the host but the log and the config reader.

### Save manifest

A save written with mod content does not load without it — the resource count
is part of the save format — and the game dies halfway through such a load
without a word. So the loader leaves a note in every save it sees written:
`tesmioloader.save.ini` next to `stats.ini`, listing the mod resources, mod
deposits and declared buildings in effect at save time, and the plugins that
were on.

When the game reads a `stats.ini` back — browsing the load menu counts — the
manifest beside it is compared against what is enabled now. Anything missing
is logged, and a warning box lists it before the game can die on it: the one
moment that information is still useful is before the load, not in the crash
report after. The check lives in the host because it has to fire exactly when
the plugin is off; one warning per save per session. `save_manifest = 0`
turns the whole thing off.

The buildings half checks the one thing the game itself checks: the folder
under `workshop_wip`. A plugin switched off but a folder written last launch
still loads, so the plugin's state is never asked.

### Crash reporting

A vectored exception handler logs the faulting address as `module + rva`, the
accessed address, registers, and return addresses found on the stack.

Two details are load-bearing. The stack walk is bounded by `VirtualQuery` on
`RSP` — an earlier version read past the end and faulted inside the handler,
burying the original crash. And exceptions raised inside `tesmioloader.dll`
itself are skipped, because the memory scanner walks off region ends routinely
and its `__except` handles that.

### Guard-page probe

Optional. Finds a buffer in memory by a marker, turns its pages into guard
pages, and records who faults on them. Written to find the deposit sampler; it
proved the pixels are never read by game code, which is what sent the search to
Ghidra. Off by default — see [03-reverse-engineering.md](03-reverse-engineering.md).

## Configuration

`tesmioloader.ini`, read once at startup, next to the DLL. It is short now:
everything a feature needs lives in that plugin's own ini.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `trace_reads` | 0 off, 1 paths containing `trace_filter`, 2 everything |
| `trace_filter` | substring filter for the trace |
| `log_game` | mirror the game's own log |
| `vfs` | enable file redirection |
| `probe_map` | guard-page probe for the deposit map |
| `probe_texel` | watch texel reads of the deposit maps |
| `save_manifest` | write `tesmioloader.save.ini` into saves and warn on missing mods |
| `plugins` | scan `plugins\` and load what is there |
| `menu_patch` | append `menu_tag` to the main menu's version line |
| `version` | this build's version, shown in the launcher's title bar |
| `version_check` | **launcher only.** 0 injects into a game that is not v1.1.1.9. Absent means 1 |

`menu_tag` also lives in this section, but it is not a setting: tesmiolauncher's
SaveConfig derives it from `version` (`"tesmioloader v. " + version`) and
rewrites it here before every launch, so it is always in step with `version`
and never worth hand-editing. ASCII only - it is read through the ANSI profile
API, so anything past 0x7F would arrive as its raw bytes - and empty leaves the
menu's version line untouched, which is what a build that has never been
launched through tesmiolauncher will see.

**One file per plugin, beside its DLL, and it holds everything that plugin
needs** — both its wiring and whatever content it declares:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `pluginsesources.ini` | the ResourceGet hook mode and the three RVAs it needs |
| `plugins\deposits.ini` | which of the three deposit subsystems may touch the game |
| `plugins\depletion.ini` | whether deposits run out, and how fast |
| `plugins\accumulator.ini` | what counts as a battery, and how fast it charges |
| `plugins\needs.ini` | what the citizens buy, and which shops stock it |
| `plugins\walking.ini` | how far a citizen walks, and whether a load rebuilds the connections |
| `plugins\buildings.ini` | the buildings that do not exist yet, one section each |

The first two carry their content in the same file: `[list]` names the
resources, and every section of `plugins\deposits.ini` that is not `[deposits]`
is a deposit. Content and wiring used to live apart, in a `resources.ini` and a
`deposits.ini` in the loader's own folder, from before there were plugins at
all. They are merged now, because "where is this feature configured" should have
one answer per feature, and deleting a plugin should not leave a stray file
behind.

Those two content sections are parsed by their own plugin rather than through
the profile API, so display names and comments may hold anything UTF-8; every
settings section goes through `configString` and stays ASCII.

Every one of these is UTF-8 **without a BOM** and read through the ANSI profile
API. Writing one back with PowerShell's `-Encoding UTF8` adds a BOM, the section
header stops matching, and every setting in the file silently falls back to its
default. This has already cost one debugging session; see
[07-pitfalls.md](07-pitfalls.md).

## Logs

Written next to the DLL, in `build/`.

| File | Contents | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `tesmioloader.log` | hooks, VFS hits, plugins, patches, the game's own log, crashes | the loader, and every plugin through `TsmHost::log` |
| `tesmioloader.reads.log` | file access trace | the loader |
| `tesmioloader.resources.log` | resource enum and record hex dumps | the `resources` plugin |

The game holds these open. Reading them while it runs needs
`FileShare.ReadWrite`; `Get-Content` alone will report an empty file.
