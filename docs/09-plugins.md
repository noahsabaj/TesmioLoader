# Plugins

A plugin is an ordinary DLL in `build/plugins/`. The loader finds it at startup,
checks it was built against a compatible `src/tesmio_api.h`, and hands it a
table of the things the loader already knows how to do. The plugin patches the
game from there.

Removing a feature is deleting its DLL. Adding one is dropping a folder in
`plugins/` and rebuilding — nothing in `build.bat` or in the loader lists them
by name.

## What is a plugin and what is not

The loader keeps only what is **infrastructure** — what has to exist before any
plugin runs, and what more than one of them may want:

| In the loader | Why |
|---|---|
| the VFS and the file hooks | every plugin's assets come through it |
| the log | one file, one timestamp order |
| IAT and inline hooking, `AllocNear`, `ReadablePtr` | the techniques, not any use of them |
| the crash handler and the guard-page probe | process-wide, and diagnostic |
| the main-menu version line | one `lea` displacement; there is nothing to modularise |
| the plugin host itself | |

Everything that is a **feature** is a plugin, including the three this project
started with:

| Plugin | What | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `resources` | resources the base game does not have. Hooks `ResourceGet`, publishes records into the engine's own vector | [04](04-adding-resources.md) |
| `deposits` | deposit types: the code patch, the minimap layer, the editor brush | [05](05-deposits.md) |
| `depletion` | deposits that run out | [08](08-depletion.md) |
| `accumulator` | batteries for the electric grid | [10](10-accumulator.md) |
| `needs` | resources the citizens buy in a shop | [11](11-needs.md) |
| `walking` | how far a citizen walks | [12](12-walking.md) |
| `buildings` | new buildings, written out of a config file | [13](13-buildings.md) |
| `cities` | a per-city radius and shape | [14](14-cities.md) |
| `daynight` | one sunrise and one sunset per calendar day | [15](15-daynight.md) |
| `easystart` | needs that arrive with the century | [16](16-easystart.md) |
| `construction` | a construction office's assignment cap | [17](17-construction.md) |

The split is not about safety. A plugin is in the same address space and can
corrupt the process exactly as easily as the loader can — there is no sandbox
and there was never going to be one. It is about being able to write, rebuild
and remove a feature without touching a shared file, and about shipping one by
copying a DLL.

## Writing one

```
plugins/
  yourthing/
    yourthing.cpp        required, and the folder name decides the DLL name
    yourthing.ini        optional, copied next to the DLL
```

**One ini per plugin, and it holds everything that plugin needs** — settings in
a `[yourthing]` section, and whatever content it declares in sections of its
own. `resources` and `deposits` both do this: `[list]` and `[copper]` sit in the
same file as the switches that drive them. There is nothing in the loader's own
folder for a plugin to read, and deleting a DLL leaves no stray file behind.

`build.bat` compiles every `plugins/<name>/<name>.cpp` into
`build/plugins/<name>.dll` and copies `<name>.ini` beside it.

The whole of the minimum:

```cpp
#include "../../src/tesmio_plugin.h"

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) unsigned TsmPluginApiVersion(void)
{
    return TSM_API_VERSION;
}

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int TsmPluginInit(const TsmHost* host, TsmPluginInfo* info)
{
    TsmBind(host);
    info->name    = "yourthing";
    info->version = "1.0";

    if (!H->configInt("plugins\\yourthing.ini", "yourthing", "enabled", 1))
        return 1;                       // non-zero: nothing hooked, unload me

    Logf("yourthing  installed");
    return 0;
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE, DWORD, LPVOID) { return TRUE; }
```

[`src/tesmio_plugin.h`](../src/tesmio_plugin.h) is the boilerplate every plugin
would otherwise repeat. It binds the host table to `H`, `g_exe`, `g_exeBase`,
`Logf`, `FindIatSlot`, `InstallInlineHook`, `ReadablePtr`, `FaultFilter` and a
few small helpers, with the same shapes the loader itself uses — so code moved
out of the loader compiles unchanged, and a new plugin reads like the loader
rather than like a foreign thing bolted to it. Header-only and everything in it
`static`, so each plugin gets its own copy; nothing but PODs crosses the
boundary.

### The two phases

```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int TsmPluginStart(void)   // optional
```

| Phase | Do | Do not |
|---|---|---|
| `TsmPluginInit` | read config, `provide` your interfaces | `consume`, hook anything |
| `TsmPluginStart` | `consume` what you need, install hooks | |

Every plugin's `Init` runs before any `Start`, which is what lets one plugin use
another **without either knowing the load order**. `depletion` and `deposits`
are exactly that case: alphabetically `depletion` loads first, but it consumes
the deposit registry in `Start`, by which time `deposits` has published it.

A plugin that depends on nothing can do everything in `Init` and omit `Start`.

Returning non-zero from either tells the loader the plugin declined — it is
freed and never called again. **Only return non-zero if nothing was hooked**,
because a plugin that installed an inline hook can never be unloaded: the game
would jump into freed memory. That is also why there is no uninstall in the API.

## The host table

`TsmHost`, in [src/tesmio_api.h](../src/tesmio_api.h). Everything crossing the
boundary is a POD or a C string; the loader and every plugin are built `/MT`, so
each has its own CRT and **nothing may be freed across the boundary**. Pointers
the host hands out stay valid for the life of the process.

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `exeBase`, `exeSize`, `exeModule` | `SOVIET64.exe`. Add an RVA to `exeBase`; ASLR is on and nothing may be hard-coded absolute |
| `engineModule` | `C3DDLL64.dll` |
| `baseDir`, `pluginDir` | where the loader and the plugins live |
| `log` | one line into `tesmioloader.log`. Prefix it with the plugin's short name, as every subsystem does |
| `findIatSlot`, `patchIat` | import table. **First choice** for anything named — no fixed addresses, survives a game update |
| `installInlineHook` | relocates a prologue into a trampoline and writes a 14-byte absolute jump. Compares the site against `expect` first and refuses on a mismatch |
| `allocNear` | executable memory within ±2 GB, for a cave a `call rel32` can reach |
| `readablePtr` | is this range committed and readable |
| `faultFilter` | for the filter expression of a `__try` around anything reading game structures |
| `configInt`, `configString` | a key out of an ini resolved against `baseDir` |
| `provide`, `consume` | the service noticeboard, below |

A vtable swap needs no host help at all — the vtable is in the engine and the
plugin can write it directly. That is still the second-best technique after an
import swap; see [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md).

## Services

How one plugin uses another. The host is only a noticeboard: it never looks
inside an interface and has no opinion on what any of them mean.

```cpp
// in the provider's Init
static const TsmDepositApi kApi = { svc_Count, svc_Get, svc_Setting };
H->provide(TSM_SERVICE_DEPOSITS, TSM_DEPOSITS_VERSION, &kApi);

// in the consumer's Start
D = (const TsmDepositApi*)H->consume(TSM_SERVICE_DEPOSITS, TSM_DEPOSITS_VERSION);
if (!D) Logf("yourthing  no deposits plugin");
```

The interface must outlive the process — a file-scope `static const` is the
obvious choice. `consume` returns null when nobody provided that name at that
version, and **a consumer has to cope with that**: it means the providing plugin
is simply not installed, which is the whole point of the architecture.

Two services exist, both declared in `tesmio_api.h` so a consumer needs one
include:

| Service | Provider | What |
|---|---|---|
| `TSM_SERVICE_DEPOSITS` | `deposits` | `deposits.ini`, parsed and validated |
| `TSM_SERVICE_RESOURCES` | `resources` | which engine index each mod resource ended up with |

### Per-deposit settings

`TsmDepositApi::setting(i, key)` returns any key of a `plugins\deposits.ini` section the
deposits plugin itself does not understand. It keeps up to eight per section
verbatim and has no opinion on what they mean, so another plugin carries its own
settings in the same file the deposit is declared in:

```ini
[copper]
token     = $TYPE_MINE_COPPER
type      = 10
...
deplete   = 4000        ; nothing in `deposits` reads this
```

```cpp
if (const char* s = D->setting(i, "deplete")) tonnes = (float)atof(s);
```

## Versioning

Two numbers, and the second one is a promise.

| Constant | What | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `TSM_API_VERSION` | this header, bumped on **every** change to it | 4 |
| `TSM_API_VERSION_MIN` | the oldest plugin this loader still initialises | 3 |

The loader accepts `TSM_API_VERSION_MIN <= reported <= TSM_API_VERSION`. Version
1 had no `Start` phase and carried the deposit registry in the host table; 2
added the split; 3 grew the deposit service; 4 appended `TsmHost::vfsRoot` -
the actual folder file reads are redirected against, which is not always
`baseDir\vfs` (see `ResolveVfsRoot` in `tesmioloader.cpp`) and which
`plugins/deposits` had been reconstructing by hand and getting wrong. A
compatible change, so `TSM_API_VERSION_MIN` did not move: a v3 plugin never
reads that far into the table, and `tesmio_plugin.h`'s `TsmBind` only copies
the field out when `host->structSize` says it is actually there.

`TsmPluginApiVersion` is called **before** `TsmPluginInit` and `Init` is not
called at all on a refusal. That ordering is the point: a plugin built against
an incompatible header would be reading moved fields out of the host table,
which corrupts the process rather than misbehaving. `TsmPluginApiVersion` must
therefore do nothing but return the constant.

### Keeping old plugins working is a requirement

**A change to `tesmio_api.h` that does not have to break an old plugin must not
break one.** Raising `TSM_API_VERSION_MIN` is the admission that it did, and it
is the only thing that stops an already-built DLL from loading.

This is not politeness. A plugin is a file somebody downloaded; the source it
was built from may not exist any more, and a host that refuses everything on
every release turns each version bump into a re-release of the whole ecosystem —
by whoever still can, for the ones nobody maintains.

**Compatible** — bump `TSM_API_VERSION`, leave `TSM_API_VERSION_MIN` alone. An
old plugin still reads exactly the bytes it was compiled to read:

* a field **appended to the very end** of `TsmHost`
* a new `#define`, a new service name, a new service interface struct
* a new optional export the host calls only when `GetProcAddress` finds it
* a new value of an existing field that an old plugin can only fail to
  recognise, never misread

**Breaking** — raise `TSM_API_VERSION_MIN` to the new `TSM_API_VERSION`:

* moving, removing, reordering or retyping **any** field of `TsmHost` or of any
  struct that crosses the boundary. Inserting a field in the middle is the
  classic one, and it is silent: every field after it shifts
* changing what an existing function does, what it returns, when it may be
  called, or which phase it belongs to
* changing the meaning of a value a plugin already passes or reads

The range is deliberately one-sided. A plugin reporting **more** than
`TSM_API_VERSION` is always refused: it was built against a header this loader
does not have, so it may read a field off the end of the table it was handed.

`TsmHost::structSize` is the other half. A plugin that wants a field added after
its own version must check it before touching that field — that is what the
field is for, and it is the only way an old plugin can use a new host's extras.

The log says which case it hit:

```
plugin   "x.dll" reports API 1, this loader takes 3..3 - not initialised
plugin   "x.dll" built against API 3, running on 4
```

The second is not a warning. It is the compatibility promise working, printed
once so a bug report says which header the plugin came from.

The launcher checks the same range before the game is even started, and marks a
plugin outside it in red — see below.

## Load order

Plugins load **last** in the loader's init, after every import swap and with the
VFS live and the crash handler armed, so a plugin sees a fully built loader.

Within the folder they load in the order `FindFirstFile` returns, which on NTFS
is alphabetical. **That order should not matter**: anything one plugin needs
from another goes through a service, and the Init/Start split makes both phases
independent of it. Ordering by name is a last resort, not a mechanism.

`plugins = 0` in `tesmioloader.ini` skips the folder entirely. It is the first
thing to try when the game will not start.

## Turning one off

A `[plugins]` section in `tesmioloader.ini`, one key per DLL named after the file
without its extension. **A key that is not there counts as 1**, so the section is
empty until something is turned off:

```ini
[plugins]
needs = 0
```

```
plugin   needs.dll        off in tesmioloader.ini [plugins]
plugin   5 loaded
```

The check happens in `LoadPlugins` before `LoadLibrary`, so a disabled plugin is
never mapped and its `DllMain` never runs.

This is what the launcher's checkboxes write, and the reason it is a config key
rather than a renamed or moved file: a plugin the user turned off is still on
disk, still listed in the window, and still one click from coming back. It also
means the state is readable by anything that can read an ini — the loader, the
launcher, and a person with a text editor — rather than being implied by which
files happen to be present.

`build\tesmioloader.ini` is therefore **live config, not a build output**.
`build.bat` copies the repo's copy over it only when it is not there yet;
delete it to take new defaults.

Three ways to switch a feature off, in order of how big the hammer is: its own
`enabled = 0` in its own ini, which still loads and initialises the DLL; the
`[plugins]` key, which does not load it at all; and `plugins = 0`, which skips
every plugin.

## Signing

The launcher says whose plugin each DLL is. A signed plugin ships
`<name>.dll.sig` beside its DLL — a `TSMSIG1` header and an ECDSA P-256
signature over the SHA-256 of the file exactly as it sits on disk — and the
launcher verifies it against the public key compiled into it from
`src/tesmio_pubkey.h`. Three states:

| In the window | In `--find` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `[tesmio]` | `signed by Tesmio` | the signature verifies — these bytes are exactly what the key holder built |
| *nothing* | *nothing* | no `.sig` file — a third-party build, or a build made without the key |
| `[SIGNATURE INVALID]` | `SIGNATURE INVALID` | a `.sig` exists and does not match the bytes; painted red |

**An unsigned plugin carries no mark at all.** It used to say "not from
Tesmio", which reads as an accusation against every third-party plugin and
against every build made from source without the private key — which is most of
them. Absence of a mark is the honest form of "nobody claims to have built
this", and it leaves `[tesmio]` meaning exactly what it says.

The middle case is the only one that goes quiet, and the last one deliberately
does not: a `.sig` that no longer matches its file is not an unsigned plugin.
Somebody signed those bytes and the bytes then changed.

The point is provenance, not sandboxing — a plugin runs in the game's address
space and can do anything the loader can, signature or not, so **the mark does
not block anything**; foreign plugins still load. What a valid signature does
say is the one thing a third party cannot fake: editing the source and
building your own plugin produces a DLL you cannot sign as Tesmio, because
that needs the private key. One changed byte turns a valid seal into
`SIGNATURE INVALID`; deleting the `.sig` is the honest way to be "not from
Tesmio".

The private key is `tools/signing/tsm_private.bin`, a 104-byte CNG blob made
once by `build\tsmsign.exe genkey`. **It is the one file a release must never
ship** — whoever has it can sign as Tesmio, and there is no revocation. Keep a
backup somewhere outside the tree; losing it means generating a new pair,
regenerating `tesmio_pubkey.h` (`tsmsign pubkey`), and every old signature
becoming invalid. The public header is safe to commit — it is public in the
cryptographic sense.

`build.bat` signs every plugin it builds when the key file is present, so a
rebuilt DLL never sits beside a stale signature, and a build on a machine
without the key simply ships unsigned. `tsmsign verify <key> <dll>` checks a
`.sig` by hand, and `tsmsign sign` re-signs a single file.

The crypto is Windows CNG (`bcrypt.dll`), which ships with every Windows this
project targets, so neither side gains a dependency. The shared format and the
primitives are `src/tesmio_sign.h`; the launcher is the only consumer of
`tesmio_pubkey.h`.

**The whole block is optional.** The launcher includes both headers through
`__has_include`, and `build.bat` skips `tsmsign.exe` and the signing pass when
their sources are missing — so a source drop without the signing machinery
still builds end to end. Such a launcher never mentions signatures at all: it
cannot recognise one, so it accuses nobody of being "not from Tesmio".

## What goes wrong, and what the log says

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `plugin   x.dll          off in tesmioloader.ini [plugins]` | its `[plugins]` key is 0. Never loaded, never initialised |
| `plugin   "x.dll" failed to load (126)` | a missing dependency, usually a non-`/MT` build |
| `plugin   "x.dll" is not a tesmioloader plugin` | one of the required exports is missing. Check `extern "C"` and `__declspec(dllexport)` |
| `plugin   "x.dll" reports API 1, this loader takes 3..3` | outside the accepted range. Rebuild it against the current header |
| `plugin   "x.dll" built against API 3, running on 4` | not a problem — an older but still compatible plugin, loaded as normal |
| `plugin   "x.dll" declined to install (1)` | `TsmPluginInit` returned non-zero, usually its own `enabled = 0` |
| `plugin   x started with 1 - inactive` | `TsmPluginStart` returned non-zero. It stays loaded, because by then it may already have hooked something |
| `plugin   service "s" v1 from x.dll` | a provider published |
| `FAULT    plugin init: ...` | it crashed while installing. The loader survives and carries on with the rest |

The loader wraps every call into a plugin in `__try`, so one that faults while
installing takes itself out rather than the process. Nothing wraps a plugin's
own hooks — that is the plugin's job, and `faultFilter` is in the table for it.

## A worked startup

```
plugin   depletion        1.0      from depletion.dll      <- Init: config only
deposits  "copper" type 10 "$TYPE_MINE_COPPER" -> ...
patch  deposit type 10 added
minimap  1 mod layer(s) hooked
editor   1 mod brush pair(s) hooked
plugin   service "deposits" v1 from deposits.dll
plugin   deposits         1.0      from deposits.dll
registry  "copper_ore" -> next free slot, template 18
hook ok      ResourceGet
plugin   service "resources" v1 from resources.dll
plugin   resources        1.0      from resources.dll
hook ok      mine tick                                     <- depletion's Start
deplete  copper     type 10  resourcemap2 component 3
plugin   3 loaded
```

Three Inits in alphabetical order, then the Starts. `depletion` hooks nothing
until its `Start`, which is after `deposits` published — which is why copper is
in its table at all.
